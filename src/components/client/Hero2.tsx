        <p className="headlineBody">A portal into the mind of T. HENDO—where imagination becomes frequency, 
          and sound becomes a world of its own.
        Here, he channels the dream-capsules of virtual energy of his childhood—games, 
        music, art, pixels, fantasy—and fuses it with the modern vibrations of R&B, Rap,
         Rock, Pop, and any genre he dares to explore. Every beat is blessed with the unmistakable
          rhythm of Chicago—a magnetic pulse you can only truly understand if you lived it, 
          breathed it, and grew up inside its culture.
       “It’s my passion to build complex, dreamy soundscapes 
       that make people feel—to sing, rap, groove, and escape. I create to uplift, to inspire, 
       and to give the world something undeniably dope to experience. These sounds lived in my head long before they existed… and I realized that with consistency, creativity, effort, and relentless attention to detail, anything is possible inside the DREAMSTATION. All you have to do is envision it, believe it, and create it. With that being said, I share this serendipity with you.”</p>
